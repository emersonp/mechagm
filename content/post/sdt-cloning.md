Lancer's lore is rich and nuanced. It's like a fire hose. But getting players to read lore is an uphill battle. It's better to show than to tell. Here are a handful of ways to show your players how cloning works in Lancer. Drink deep.

### Cloning

Cloning in Lancer "occupies a space of grey legality", which means that you can do pretty much anything you want with it, as a GM. But there are some implications, such as the fact that your clone is not really you. And there is some factional history that your players aren't going to read.^[The most powerful military factions are still using the very illegal flash cloning processes for fun and profit.]

### Cloudcuckoolander

When you're cloned, you come back with a quirk. Make sure one of your NPCs is cloned. Make it clear that they're not quite right in the head (or body), that the NPC is still coming to terms with their new form.

#### The Queen is Dead...

_Long live the Queen._ Or feel free to take it a step further. Kill an NPC. Someone beloved. Someone cherished. And then, have them come back. But it's not quite them.

Note that this one is tricky, because the subtle hints that someone is not the same can become lost when narrated by a GM, unless the GM is particularly heavy handed about it. Either go with one of the physical changes (vat scar, vestigial arm), or do it to a player beloved by the NPCs who has been around long enough for their quirks to become known; then reverse them.
