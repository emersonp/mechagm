Lancer's lore is rich and nuanced. It's like a fire hose. But getting players to read lore is an uphill battle. It's better to show than to tell. Here are a handful of ways to show your players how cloning works in Lancer. Drink deep.

### Cloning

Cloning in Lancer "occupies a space of grey legality", which means that you can do pretty much anything you want with it, as a GM. But there are some implications, such as the fact that your clone is not really you. And there is some factional history that your players aren't going to read.^[The most powerful military factions are still using the very illegal flash cloning processes for fun and profit.]

### Cloudcuckoolander

When you're cloned, you come back with a quirk. Make sure one of your NPCs is cloned. Make it clear that they're not quite right in the head (or body), that the NPC is still coming to terms with their new form.

#### The Queen is Dead...

_Long live the Queen._ Or feel free to take it a step further. Kill an NPC. Someone beloved. Someone cherished. And then, have them come back. But it's not quite them.

Note that this one is tricky, because the subtle hints that someone is not the same can become lost when narrated by a GM, unless the GM is particularly heavy handed about it. Either go with one of the physical changes (vat scar, vestigial arm), or do it to a player beloved by the NPCs who has been around long enough for their quirks to become known; then reverse them.

### Long Live the New Flesh
> _Partial cloning is common enough in the medical field. Tissue, major organs, viable follicles, limbs, and bodily fluids -- nothing capable of conscious or unconscious thought -- are all commonly cloned in order to provide a donor exact-match replacements, generally to satisfy medical requirements. Again in this case, donors must display informed consent as determined by their culture or state before even this type of cloning is allowed._

Cloned tissue as a cure-all to injury might be the simplest way to show players how pervasive cloning is in Lancer. Make the players use it.

Narrative Complications can be as varied as the predicaments the players find themselves in. One potential Compliaction is the total destruction of their body. Don't _kill_ a player, but when the circumstances are right, a potential complication can be a _lot_ Harm.

The usual Harm is 1-2 damage, though the nature of what the player is attempting can increase that. A GM shouldn't usually cause excessive Harm without telegraphing the danger, _but_, I think they can do so if they immediately offer amelioration. If a player fails a roll to sneak into an SSC attache's offices, maybe instead of getting caught, an automated security system sprays them with a weaponized flesh-eating virus.

Leaving them without flesh.

That's a lot of pain and a lot of Harm, and not usually what a player might expect from a failed **Unseen and Unheard** roll. But if the mission's patron immediately pays for a new skinsuit, that's a much fairer, and more interesting, outcome. Especially if the players start to wonder why their patron has all this cloned DNA of them waiting on standby.

### Clone Troopers

> _"The Harrison Armory Impossible Soldiers are far more than mere flash clones. Battle ready in under five years, these soldiers have the volition, creativity, and tactical cunning to win you the war you can't lose. With a cleaner genetic profile than any other brand, and an expected life span of almost 100 years[1], these are the clones of tomorrow._
> 
> [1] _Objective._

There are still plenty of armies of flash clones in use by Harrison Armory, the Karrakin Trade Baronies, and any syndicate or despot willing to do something illegal. Gunning down a field full of soldiers, _all of whom look exactly the same_, can drive home the point that despite the rhetoric from Union, clones are still very much a way of life on the Far Rim.

_**Harrison Armory Flash Clone Infantry Squad**  
Squad, Biological_

Infantry squads make all mech saves or checks with +2/tier

**Primary squad weapon**  
Main Rifle  
Range 10  
+2 vs evasion/tier  
3/4/5 energy damage.
This weapon can be fired three times when the squad attacks. If the squad is under ½ HP, it can only be fired once.

**Anti-mech squad weapon**  
Heavy Cannon  
Range 20 
+1 vs evasion/tier  
4/5/6 AP explosive damage.

**Disciplined**  
Trait  
The squad doesn't lose attacks for being under 1/2 HP.

**Predictable**  
Trait  
If the squad moves or boosts during its turn, all enemies gain +1 Accuracy when attacking it until the start of the squad's next turn.

**Weak**  
Trait  
Squads cannot have more than 1 structure or heat capacity. They take energy damage when they take heat.

**Strength in numbers**  
Trait  
Squads have resistance to all damage that is not from line, blast, or cone attacks. They are immune to grapple or ram, cannot grapple or ram, and are immune to the knock back, stun, and shut down conditions.

**Split HP**  
Trait  
Squads have a large number of members operating together. Once a certain amount of damage is done to the squad, one of the members is destroyed (indicated in the profile). Once a squad is under half HP, it loses some of its attacks to represent this.

**Spread out**  
Trait  
Squads occupy a square area equal to their size for purposes of targeting. Each individual member must stay in this area. For the purposes of determining cover and obstruction, use the size of each individual member, not the size of a squad as a whole.

**Exclusive templates**  
Squads cannot take the Grunt, Veteran, or Ultra templates (they can still take Elite, but don’t gain structure)

| HP | Evade | E-D | Heat | H | A | S | E | Armor | Spd | Sense | Save | Size |

_It's a hard knock life._

### Mini-Me

Cloning is entirely legal if you're willing to treat your clone as a new individual.

Say, as an heir.

The relativistic nature of the Lancer universe, combined with future medicine, means that the PCs can often encounter many generations of NPCs, all as adults. What if the leader of a close-knit group or family wished to ensure as complete loyalty in their heir as possible. By cloning themself.

> _House Argent is a small house, but uniquely positioned as the House of Smoke's most smuggler-connected network of families. The Baroness Fess, Third of Her Name, has maneuvered her House into a place of great strength within Argent, and is not prepared to let her work go to waste._
>
> _She cloned herself raised the clone as her daughter. The Lady Lamare has the guile and natural talents of her 'mother', paired with all the confidence that comes from knowing that 'she' has already succeeded once. When the Baroness Fess dies, which is likely to be soon, the Lady Lamare will oversee an operation generations in the making, that will likely result in House Argent being subsumed into House Fess._

> _The worlds under SSC’s direct control are, generally, small worlds -- atmospheric moons and pleasant temperate worlds that are lightly developed, with tightly controlled populations that are guided towards arranged couplings in order to create biome-specific lines of bespoke colony seed. The people on these worlds are aware of SSC’s mission, and most are content with their situation. Save for a donation of genetic material (a few hairs, a drop of blood) and a cultural insistence on arranged coupling, life on a Constellation World is largely similar to that of life on a given non-SSC core world._

> &mdash; **Lancer Core Rules**

Not all uses of cloning in Lancer are nefarious or transactional or inhumane. Sometimes, small colonies are thrust forward in size with the use of clones. Once the initial infrastructure is in place, batches of clones can be added to the colony in order to accelerate its natural growth.

A small SSC colony (15,000 to 50,000) people could highlight the more mundane uses of cloning. An entire city dominated by the bespoke clones of others. Likely falling along hard generational lines as the NHP in charge decided the community was ready for an influx of people. While each genetically unique, all bearing the same SSC-curated trates needed for success on this new world.
