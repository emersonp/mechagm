The first four origins on my quest to chronicle all 200. The **Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company**, organized lancers for hire. **Adrenaline Junkies**, taking only the most thrilling jobs.

### 1.) Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company

**Who Are We?** _An infamous private military corporation_  
**Who Gives Us Orders?** _Our commanding officer_

To begin with, a cliche and a default.

> _A pan-galactic mercenary organization known for its low rates, broad portfolio, and civic legitimization service, MSMC is formally incorporated as a “greyspace” private military company. No job is too big or small, as long as a state with good standing in Union will call it legal. Greyspace is an informal legal term, perfect for Mirrorsmoke’s operational preference: their legal corps, in contrast with their mercenary corps, is viewed as a prestigious, cutthroat interstellar law firm, especially in the fields of orbital, terrestrial, and criminal law._
