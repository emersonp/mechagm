The first origin on my quest to chronicle all 200. The **Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company**, organized lancers for hire.

### 1.) Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company

**Who Are We?** _An infamous private military corporation_  
**Who Gives Us Orders?** _Our commanding officer_

To begin with, a cliche and a default.

> _A pan-galactic mercenary organization known for its low rates, broad portfolio, and civic legitimization service, MSMC is formally incorporated as a “greyspace” private military company. No job is too big or small, as long as a state with good standing in Union will call it legal. Greyspace is an informal legal term, perfect for Mirrorsmoke’s operational preference: their legal corps, in contrast with their mercenary corps, is viewed as a prestigious, cutthroat interstellar law firm, especially in the fields of orbital, terrestrial, and criminal law._

This is about the simplest Lancer campaign concept you can get. The player characters are freelancers, taking any job that'll pay, with the logistical backup of a major faction. Clear orders, well-established pathways to new adventures, and no need for an overarching story other than "The Quest for Profit", a Mirrorsmoke campaign is about as simple as it gets.

Though that simplicity comes with a little bit of risk as a GM: that lack of overarching story can lead to a lack of overarching _motivation_. If your players like mech combat for the sake of mech combat, it's a low risk. But if your players want more story, you'll have to come up with some driving subplots based on each character's backstory.

#### The Patron: Zosima Mao

Mao was a good attorney. One of the best. One of the best at _Mirrorsmoke Legal_. Her skill was legendary, a rising star on everybody's radar. She was cunning, she was vicious, she was relentless. Her temper was almost as legendary as her knowledge of relativistic interpretations of subadmiralty jurisprudence.

There were whispers that she'd run the Mirrorsmoke legal corps one day. Maybe even Mirrorsmoke as a whole.

Some say she punched a client. Some say she killed one. There are those who say that she killed a client and everybody else on their shuttle.

Mirrorsmoke treats its legal clients with unflappable professionalism at all times. Anybody else would be fired or dead. Mao was not anybody else.

A quiet transfer, and now she runs a new small detachment in Mirrorsmoke, the 221st "Paracausal Paralegals". She's determined to make the 221st the elite team within Mirrorsmoke, and will do anything to regain her former position. She'll never fail her pilots, as long as they never fail her.

There are whispers that she'll run the Mirrorsmoke mercenary corps one day. Maybe even Mirrorsmoke as a whole.

#### The Villains

**The Targets.** This one is easy. Your enemy is the people working on the other side of the job. You've been hired to do something and they're the mechs who are trying to stop you.

**Mirrorsmoke Rivals.** The 221st isn't the only detachment trying to shine on MSMC quarterly reports. And Zosima Mao made a lot of enemies during her rise and her fall. In-fighting in the MSMC is rare, but a little "healthy competition" and unfortunate friendly fire aren't entirely inconceivable.

#### On the Ground

The blank canvas of a group of mercenaries means there aren't immediately a lot of obvious downtime stories. The player characters are the hard-bitten type who are likely to find themselves with their own personal motivations, but the MSMC backdrop is probably pretty quiet.

However, _during_ the mission, there is plenty to do out of the mech. A target may be deep within a building or space station. Fighting through a horde of enemy mechs may only be the first step, with a quick jaunt through a well-defended interior structure being the meat and potatoes in the middle. Mercenaries providing protection may be assigned to accompany their charges to fancy balls, or with the Sisyphean task of retrieving them from the depths of one mysterious city after another.

Mirrorsmoke mercs aren't just pilots, they're _lancers_, capable of great feats in and out of the cockpit.

#### Operation Snake Eyes

The small moon of _Tenebrous_ is a quiet, hidden Constellar World in a forgotten corner of the Sierra Madre. For generations, Smith-Shimano scientists have worked to unlock the secrets left by the Deimos Event.

Recent (highly illegal) research into variant shackling protocols has gone... awry. The NHP DENWEN has taken over much of the compound, and SSC has turned to the MSMC to reclaim their research.

And their scientists, if it's not too inconvenient.

**Notable NPCs**  

* DENWEN. _Polite. Obsessive._ An NHP who is obsessed with fire, specifically with melting flesh. Whether DENWEN is shackled is a matter of debate, but they are certainly cascading.
* Senior Scientist Jack Lindskog. _Panicked. Industrious._ Lindskog is the head scientist for the project that created DENWEN. He has watched most of his colleagues be burned alive in one fashion or another and is not doing well emotionally.
* Constable Alina Shostak. _Laughing. Level-headed._ Shostak was a Constellar Midnight for most of her life,^[Does one ever _stop_ being a Constellar Midnight?], and Tenebrous was meant to be her retirement. The DENWEN situation is a bad, but she's seen worse.

**Mission Structure**
Lindskog's research community consists of a few different campuses, spread out over a few miles near a lake. DENWEN is keeping the researchers captive while it readies itself to take over other settlements on Tenebrous. It has installed military comp/con units into various mechs.

* **Fight 1** is the liberation of the non-technical prisoners, held captive in a warehouse by DENWEN. Shostak is among the prisoners. Much of the opposition should be retrofitted civilian mechs (Grunts). As a secondary goal, there is a munitions cache, and getting the prisoners to it will give the PCs an Infantry ally.
* **Fight 2** is the liberation of the technical prisoners. Denwen is aware of the PCs now, bringing an elite or veteran frame. The terrain features traps installed to thwart mech incursion.

The PCs can leave their mechs with the technical staff (who will repair and restock their mechs), while they infiltrate the main science campus (a narrative stealth mission). The primary desire of the client SSC is the recovery of the research protocols, which are in a building filled with comp/con units.

While the PCs are recovering the docks, DENWEN's forces drive off their drop shuttle with artillery units. If the PCs want off planet, they're going to have to retake a dropzone.

* **Fight 3** is the assault of DENWEN's anti-aircraft installations, protected by heavy tanks and heavy artillery.

* **Fight 4** occurs as the dropship approaches to recover the PCs and the civilians, so too does DENWEN. DENWEN has installed their casket into a powerful custom mech (elite or veteran Pyro), and the PCs have to hold DENWEN and their forces off while the civilians board the drop ships.

**Possible Future Complications**

* DENWEN escaped.
* The technology that created DENWEN was replicated at other sites on Tenebrous.
* DENWEN has lined the lava caves of Tenebrous with powerful Ragnarok Mines and the PCs must prevent the moon from breaking up.
