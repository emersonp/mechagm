Lancer asks two questions of the players at the outset of a campaign: **Who Are We?** and **Who Gives Us Orders?** These are key questions for any group to answer, and I'd generally encourage any group to dive in deep to answering them. But sometimes, a group just wants to dive in and do some mech-fighting. When that happens, a handy list of pregenerate campaign concepts might come in handy.

Partly for my own personal amusement, and partly as an excuse to explore every nook and cranny of the Lancer lore, I'm going to be working my way through all 200 combinations from the two tables. I'll try to give enough information so that a tired GM, running a one-shot, has enough to go on when players say "We're guardians of an ancient royal lineage, and we obey the whisperings of a long-dead monolith."

The tables are recreated here.
