Three more origins on my quest to chronicle all 200. **Adrenaline Junkies**, taking only the most thrilling jobs. The **Chaplain Corps**, for both spiritual _and_ military uplift. And the **"Big Cats"**, Union's Customs unit.

### 2.) Adrenaline Junkies

**Who Are We?** _Glory-seeking warriors_  
**Who Gives Us Orders?** _Anyone who pays us_

Flying from world to world? Not cheap. Maintaining a top-of-the-line mech? Not cheap. The bar tab you run up? Definitely not cheap. So yes, you do expect to get paid.

But that's not why you do it.

Have you ever wrestled a megafauna in the heart of a tectonic fissure? Have you ever had a mechasword fight with a privateer on the body of a soaring comet? Have you ever been betrayed in a dropship over a world glassed by nuclear war and had to fight your way out as your ship plummeted to the surface? Because if not, you haven't truly lived.

Technically, you're a mercenary company. But you care less about the manna, and more about how interesting the job is. You'll turn down good paydays if they just want you to babysit, and a truly epic fight you'll do at cost.

#### The Patron: Hwa Shin-Young 

Hwa Shin-Young used to do what you do. There are few people you'd rather listen to in a bar than him. He's a legend: "Rebel Vortex" has participated in some of the most daring raids in the history of mechanized combat.

Then a mission on a Constellation World left him with a bad case of Thrippet's Syndrome. And he hasn't been in a mech since.

He lives vicariously through his pilots now. Finding them jobs, dealing with clients, selling them on his pilots' inimitable skill. Chiding you on, voicing only enough caution to make sure you live another day. Making sure your mechs are in good repair and that the ship is always ready to go.

Hwa laughs a lot, but there's always sadness in his eyes.

#### The Villains

**The Terrain.** This should be first and foremost in an Adrenaline Junkie campaign. The greatest threats to the player characters should be the untamed wilds they fight in. Volcanoes. Glaciers. Shattered moons. If you can't make the terrain a feature, make it a dominant backdrop.

**Megafauna.** Mecha vs Kaiju, step right up. The only thing more glorious than punching another mech in the face is punching a giant lizard.

**Legends.** Every good campaign and every good Lancer campaign should have some recurring villains and named NPCs, enemies for whom the players' expectations have been building. But in an Adrenaline Junkies campaign, it is essential that half the mechs the players fight are known quantities, each with their own [Borderlands-style intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbHB2T-ihsc). 

#### On the Ground

Downtime during Adrenaline Junkie campaigns should be one long comedy of errors. Player characters are famous celebrities, the lancers of myth and legend. They're invited to parties and soirees and events that inevitably goes pear shaped, such that their vacations end up looking like _Die Hard_.

If the players aren't telling a story, they're living one. The default downtime action is almost certainly _Get A Damn Drink_.

### 3.) Chaplain Corps

**Who Are We?** _Union regulars, career soldiers_  
**Who Gives Us Orders?** _The Hierophant or high priest_

> _"Whenever and wherever possible, all due rights and privileges shall be accorded to local law, rule, custom, cultural norm, and tradition, where such accordance would not violate the rights defined in the Declaration of Union Rights and Values (Enumerated), and would not violate the rights and privileges of the Administrative Personnel."_
> <p class="tr-ns">&mdash; Union Uplift And Interaction Manual (5015u), Section 423.</p>

Out on the rim, there are a lot of lost and unique cultures. Minor variations of cultural norms, given a thousand years to blossom and diverge in isolation. Almost unrecognizable to those back at the Core.

Nothing requires more sensitivity by the Union than the theocracies. Worlds wrapped in faith, where religious law is equal to or greater than the laws of man. Where the leaders of society are granted their position not by merit or public will but by divine right. These worlds are ripe for assimilation into the Union body politic, but they pose questions.

The Union Naval Chaplain Corps is the answer. Each soldier in the Chaplaincy is as much diplomat as soldier, warriors trained in both the pen and the sword. You are expected to be as much an exemplar of Union values as you are to be a wielder of war.

Faith is not required to be assigned to the Corps, but it is a rare Naval officer who finds themself in the Chaplaincy without the comfort of belief.

The Chaplain Corps goes to worlds in need, upholds the values of Union, and demonstrates that "uplift" need not be synonymous with "heresy". Each officer is a practioner of their own esoteric traditions, and yet, the Corps comes together to bring the light of justice and equality to the galaxy.

![Talwasa Sarpara](/img/200_origins_part3_sarpara.png# fr ba ma-4 )
<!--https://www.artstation.com/artwork/JDy80-->

#### The Patron: Talwasa Sarpara

A priestess of Hel, Goddess of Death, Talwasa Sarpara was raised in a Core World with all the affluence of a good family name. After the loss of her husband, she found solace in the Reformation Asatro and the friends she found there. She rededicated herself to the Work, eventually becoming a priestess within the Asatro. During her studies, she requested a transfer to the Chaplain Corps.

Now, she hopes to bring the light of Union to the lost worlds, to the forgotten corners of the Orion Spur. She is a deeply faithful woman, though like most of the Asatro she cares little for evangelism. She is soft spoken in a personal context, but speaks with command and fire as a priestess or Wing Commander.

### 4.) "Big Cats" - Union Bureau of Customs and Transit Protection

**Who Are We?** _Enforcers of the Law_  
**Who Gives Us Orders?** _A corporate patron or sponsor_

The Union Naval Customs and Transit Protection Bureau is, depending on who you ask, an arm of the UEB, the Union Department of Interstellar Transportation, or IPS-Northstar. Just because you didn't steal your cargo doesn't mean it's legal. Union has very strict rules on what can and cannot be shipped through its blink gates.

Affectionately known as the "Big Cats", the Bureau of Customs is responsible for ensuring that all traffic between Union systems (whether or not it uses the blink gates) is legal and above board.

Technically a bureau within DoIT, the Big Cats are well connected to both the UEB and to the IPS-N private navy. Big Cats not only search ships for contraband, they also hunt down and arrest known repeat offenders.

#### The Patron: Alistair Nucci
Alistair "Ancient Viper" Nucci is a fan of three things: catching smugglers, killing pirates, and omninet mystery procedurals. Two of those they get to enjoy professionally.

A veteran of a number of IPS-N campaigns, Nucci eventually took a job with the Bureau as a "corporate resource allocation liaison". They're afforded all the rank of a Lieutenant with the Auxiliaries (much of the Bureau is drawn from Auxiliary administrative staff). Nucci trains and leads teams through customs enforcement, before sending them off on their own.

Nucci is very much an IPS-N partisan, but takes their oaths to Union seriously. They are often dressed in IPS-N attire, and express disgust with pirates, thieves, smugglers, and those who make money by skirting the laws of the civilized. When not in their mech stomping marauders, they're usually found curled up in the ship's galley with a mug of tea and an omninet procedural.
